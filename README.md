Case Study: Bellabeat Fitness Data Analysis – Google Data Analytics Capstone

# Bellabeat Capstone – Google Data Analytics Certificate  
## ASK – Business Task

**Business Task:**  
Analyze Fitbit smart device usage data to identify trends related to physical activity, sleep, and daily behavior that can be applied to Bellabeat’s target users. The insights gained will support strategic marketing recommendations to improve the positioning and usage of Bellabeat products.

**Stakeholders:**  
- Urška Sršen – Co-founder and Chief Creative Officer  
- Sando Mur – Co-founder and key executive team member  
- Bellabeat Marketing Team – Responsible for applying insights to campaigns and strategies  
- Bellabeat Data Analytics Team – Including myself as a junior data analyst, responsible for preparing and presenting the analysis

**Guiding Analysis Questions:**  
1. What patterns of daily activity (steps, intensity levels, and calories) do users show throughout the week?  
2. How do sleep habits relate to physical activity and caloric expenditure?  
3. At what times of the day are users most and least active, and how can Bellabeat leverage this information to enhance its marketing strategies?

## PREPARE — Data Collection & Integrity Review

**Data Source:**  
The dataset used for this analysis comes from the Fitabase 2016 Fitness Tracker Data made available by Möbius. It includes behavioral data collected from Fitbit devices between March and May 2016. The dataset contains information on daily activity, steps, sleep, intensity levels, calories, heart rate, and weight logs.

Although the study includes 30 Fitbit users, not all users appear in every dataset. Participation varies based on which features were enabled on the device and whether users manually logged information such as weight.

**Files Included:**  
The following CSV files were used in the analysis and stored in the project repository under `data/raw/`:

- dailyActivity_merged.csv  
- heartrate_seconds_merged.csv  
- hourlyCalories_merged.csv  
- hourlyIntensities_merged.csv  
- hourlySteps_merged.csv  
- minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged.csv  
- minuteIntensitiesNarrow_merged.csv  
- minuteMETsNarrow_merged.csv  
- minuteSleep_merged.csv  
- minuteStepsNarrow_merged.csv  
- weightLogInfo_merged.csv  

**Structural Review:**  
All datasets were inspected in R using `glimpse()`, `head()`, and row/column counts.  
Key observations include:

- dailyActivity → 457 rows, 15 columns  
- heartrate_seconds → 1,154,681 rows, 3 columns  
- hourly datasets → ~24,000 rows  
- minute-level datasets → ~1.4 million rows  
- weightLogInfo → 33 rows, 8 columns  

This inspection confirms variability in data volume and completeness across datasets.

**ROCCC Evaluation:**  

**Reliability:**  
Data is collected directly from Fitbit devices, but some data (such as weight) depends on manual user logging. Not all users enabled all features (e.g., heart rate, sleep).

**Originality:**  
The dataset is third-party generated by Fitabase. It is authentic but not collected specifically for Bellabeat.

**Comprehensiveness:**  
Not all users appear in all datasets.  
Some datasets are extremely small (e.g., weight logs).  
Heart rate and sleep tracking are incomplete for many participants.

**Consistency:**  
Different datasets use different timestamp formats and column naming conventions, requiring standardization during processing.

**Currentness:**  
The dataset is from 2016. It is historically useful but not reflective of current Fitbit behavior or Bellabeat users.

**Key Limitations:**  
- Uneven participation across datasets  
- Small sample size (30 users)  
- Missing or incomplete data in several key areas  
- Possible bias toward highly engaged users  
- Weight data available for only a few users  

**Tool Selection:**  
RStudio Cloud was chosen as the primary analysis tool due to its ability to handle large datasets, integrate with GitHub, and support reproducible workflows using tidyverse.
