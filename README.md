Case Study: Bellabeat Fitness Data Analysis – Google Data Analytics Capstone

# Bellabeat Capstone – Google Data Analytics Certificate  
## ASK – Business Task

**Business Task:**  
Analyze Fitbit smart device usage data to identify trends related to physical activity, sleep, and daily behavior that can be applied to Bellabeat’s target users. The insights gained will support strategic marketing recommendations to improve the positioning and usage of Bellabeat products.

**Stakeholders:**  
- Urška Sršen – Co-founder and Chief Creative Officer  
- Sando Mur – Co-founder and key executive team member  
- Bellabeat Marketing Team – Responsible for applying insights to campaigns and strategies  
- Bellabeat Data Analytics Team – Including myself as a junior data analyst, responsible for preparing and presenting the analysis

**Guiding Analysis Questions:**  
1. What patterns of daily activity (steps, intensity levels, and calories) do users show throughout the week?  
2. How do sleep habits relate to physical activity and caloric expenditure?  
3. At what times of the day are users most and least active, and how can Bellabeat leverage this information to enhance its marketing strategies?

## PREPARE — Data Collection & Integrity Review

**Data Source:**  
The dataset used for this analysis comes from the Fitabase 2016 Fitness Tracker Data made available by Möbius. It includes behavioral data collected from Fitbit devices between March and May 2016. The dataset contains information on daily activity, steps, sleep, intensity levels, calories, heart rate, and weight logs.

Although the study includes 30 Fitbit users, not all users appear in every dataset. Participation varies based on which features were enabled on the device and whether users manually logged information such as weight.

**Files Included:**  
The following CSV files were used in the analysis and stored in the project repository under `data/raw/`:

- dailyActivity_merged.csv  
- heartrate_seconds_merged.csv  
- hourlyCalories_merged.csv  
- hourlyIntensities_merged.csv  
- hourlySteps_merged.csv  
- minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged.csv  
- minuteIntensitiesNarrow_merged.csv  
- minuteMETsNarrow_merged.csv  
- minuteSleep_merged.csv  
- minuteStepsNarrow_merged.csv  
- weightLogInfo_merged.csv  

**Structural Review:**  
All datasets were inspected in R using `glimpse()`, `head()`, and row/column counts.  
Key observations include:

- dailyActivity → 457 rows, 15 columns  
- heartrate_seconds → 1,154,681 rows, 3 columns  
- hourly datasets → ~24,000 rows  
- minute-level datasets → ~1.4 million rows  
- weightLogInfo → 33 rows, 8 columns  

This inspection confirms variability in data volume and completeness across datasets.

**ROCCC Evaluation:**  

**Reliability:**  
Data is collected directly from Fitbit devices, but some data (such as weight) depends on manual user logging. Not all users enabled all features (e.g., heart rate, sleep).

**Originality:**  
The dataset is third-party generated by Fitabase. It is authentic but not collected specifically for Bellabeat.

**Comprehensiveness:**  
Not all users appear in all datasets.  
Some datasets are extremely small (e.g., weight logs).  
Heart rate and sleep tracking are incomplete for many participants.

**Consistency:**  
Different datasets use different timestamp formats and column naming conventions, requiring standardization during processing.

**Currentness:**  
The dataset is from 2016. It is historically useful but not reflective of current Fitbit behavior or Bellabeat users.

**Key Limitations:**  
- Uneven participation across datasets  
- Small sample size (30 users)  
- Missing or incomplete data in several key areas  
- Possible bias toward highly engaged users  
- Weight data available for only a few users  

**Tool Selection:**  
RStudio Cloud was chosen as the primary analysis tool due to its ability to handle large datasets, integrate with GitHub, and support reproducible workflows using tidyverse.

## PROCESS — Data Cleaning and Preparation

### Tools Used
- R (Posit Cloud)
- tidyverse packages (dplyr, readr, lubridate)

### Data Integrity Checks
The datasets were checked for structural and data quality issues before analysis.

- Verified dataset dimensions and column structures using `str()` and `glimpse()`
- Checked for missing values using `colSums(is.na())`
- Checked for duplicated rows using `duplicated()`

### Data Cleaning Actions

**Daily Activity Dataset**
- No missing values detected
- No duplicated rows detected
- Converted `ActivityDate` from character to Date format

**Hourly Datasets (steps, calories, intensity)**
- No missing values detected
- No duplicated rows detected
- Converted `ActivityHour` from character to POSIXct datetime format

**Sleep Minute Dataset**
- Detected duplicated rows
- Removed duplicates using `distinct()`

### Validation
After cleaning:
- All datasets contain consistent data types
- Date and datetime fields are properly formatted
- Datasets are ready for analysis at daily and hourly levels

## ANALYZE – Data Analysis

### Analysis Approach
The analysis was conducted at two levels:
- Daily-level analysis to understand overall activity, sedentary behavior, and calorie expenditure.
- Hourly-level analysis to identify patterns of activity throughout the day.

### Key Findings – Daily Level
- The average daily step count across users is approximately 6,500 steps.
- Users spend a high proportion of the day in sedentary behavior (around 990 minutes on average).
- There is a moderate positive correlation between total daily steps and calories burned.
- A negative relationship exists between daily steps and sedentary minutes.
- Users with higher activity levels tend to have fewer sedentary minutes per day.

### Key Findings – Hourly Level
- Activity levels are lowest during late night and early morning hours.
- Step activity increases steadily in the morning, peaking during midday and early evening.
- Activity declines again during late evening hours.
- These patterns suggest consistent daily routines across users.

### Business Insights
- Increased physical activity is associated with higher calorie expenditure and reduced sedentary time.
- Specific low-activity time windows present opportunities for behavioral nudges and reminders.
- Understanding hourly activity patterns can help Bellabeat optimize the timing of engagement notifications.

## SHARE — Data Visualization & Key Insights

### Insight 1: Average Steps by Hour of Day

User activity follows a clear daily pattern. Average steps are lowest during early morning hours (12 AM–5 AM), increase sharply starting at 6 AM, and peak around midday (12 PM) and early evening (6–7 PM). Activity then declines significantly after 8 PM.

This pattern suggests that users are most active during typical daytime and early evening hours, while late night and early morning periods show minimal movement.

**Business implication:**  
Bellabeat could leverage this insight to schedule motivational reminders during low-activity hours (early morning or late evening) and reinforce healthy habits or challenges during peak activity periods.

### Insight 2: Relationship Between Steps and Calories Burned

The scatter plot shows a clear positive relationship between average daily steps and average daily calories burned. Users who take more steps per day generally burn more calories, although the relationship is not perfectly linear.

This suggests that while step count is a strong driver of calorie expenditure, other factors such as activity intensity, duration, and individual differences also influence total calories burned.

**Business implication:**  
Bellabeat can emphasize step-based goals as an effective way to increase calorie burn, while also promoting higher-intensity activities for users who want to maximize energy expenditure without significantly increasing step count.

### Insight 3: Average Daily Sleep Duration

The visualization shows that most users sleep between 5 and 7 hours per night on average. Sleep duration remains relatively consistent over time, with occasional peaks and dips but no strong upward or downward trend.

This indicates that while users maintain regular sleep patterns, a large portion may not be reaching the recommended 7–9 hours of sleep consistently.

**Business implication:**  
Bellabeat could use this insight to promote sleep education features, personalized bedtime reminders, and recovery-focused recommendations to help users improve overall sleep duration and quality.
